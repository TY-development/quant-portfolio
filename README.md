# Quant Portfolio – Taiga Yamauchi

A curated collection of my quantitative research projects, machine learning
experiments, time-series studies, and infrastructure tools.  
This repository represents my core work for systematic trading, predictive modeling,
and data-driven market research.

---

## 🔍 Overview
This portfolio highlights:
- A full **systematic trading project** with feature engineering, ML models, and backtesting  
- Several **small quantitative tasks** demonstrating data cleaning, preprocessing,
  event studies, and time-series analysis  
- **Mathematical notes** used for quantitative interview preparation  
- **Research notes** exploring market microstructure, factor behavior, and predictive signals  
- **Infrastructure tools** (Docker/AWS) for reproducible research environments

My goal is to build robust, interpretable, and statistically sound pipelines for
systematic investing and quantitative analysis.
